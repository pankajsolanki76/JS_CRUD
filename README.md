# JS_CRUD

# Initialize the Array
Begin by creating an empty array in your JavaScript file. This array will hold the data items.


# Create HTML Input Fields and Buttons
Create input fields for the user to type in the data they want to add to the array.
Add an "Add Item" button that triggers the JavaScript function to add the entered data to the array.


# Write a Function to Add Items to the Array
Capture the value entered in the input field when the button is clicked.
Validate the input to ensure that the field is not empty.
Use the push() method to add the value to the array.
Clear the input field after adding the item.
Call a function to update the display of the array.


# Display the Array Items
Use HTML to create a table or list that displays the items from the array.
Create a function that loops through the array and dynamically displays each item in the table or list.


# Implement the Edit Function
Add an "Edit" button next to each item in the displayed array.
When clicked, allow the user to modify the existing value.
Validate the new value and update the array using the array[index] = newValue; method.
Refresh the table or list to reflect the updated value.


# Implement the Delete Function
Add a "Delete" button next to each item in the displayed array.
When the "Delete" button is clicked, remove the item from the array using the splice() method.
Refresh the display after deleting the item.


# Continuously Update the Display
After every Create, Read, Update, or Delete operation, refresh the display to ensure the updated array is shown.


# Test the Application
Test to make sure that:
You can add new items to the array.
The array displays the items correctly.
Items can be edited and deleted.
